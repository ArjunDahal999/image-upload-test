# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive image upload system that allows authenticated users to upload multiple images through a web interface. The system includes both a frontend upload page with drag-and-drop functionality and a secure backend API endpoint that handles file validation, storage, and processing. The feature is designed specifically for salon image uploads with proper authentication, file type validation, and automatic featured image selection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to upload multiple images through a web interface, so that I can easily add visual content to my salon profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN a user drags and drops files onto the upload area THEN the system SHALL accept the dropped files
4. WHEN a user uploads images THEN the system SHALL display upload progress indicators
5. WHEN upload is complete THEN the system SHALL show success confirmation with uploaded image previews

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure only authenticated users can upload images, so that unauthorized access is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the upload page THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user makes an API request THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
3. WHEN a user's session expires during upload THEN the system SHALL handle the authentication error gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate uploaded files, so that only appropriate image files are stored and security is maintained.

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL only accept JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats
2. WHEN a user uploads a file larger than 5MB THEN the system SHALL reject the file with an error message
3. WHEN a user uploads an invalid file type THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN multiple files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate each file individually

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded images to be properly organized and accessible, so that they can be used effectively in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in the /public/uploads/salons/ directory
2. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate unique filenames to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN multiple images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically mark the first image as featured
4. WHEN images are stored THEN the system SHALL return the file URLs and metadata

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the upload process, so that I understand what's happening and can respond to any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upload starts THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
2. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
3. WHEN upload succeeds THEN the system SHALL show success confirmation
4. WHEN files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show progress for each file
5. WHEN there are validation errors THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic files

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during upload THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
